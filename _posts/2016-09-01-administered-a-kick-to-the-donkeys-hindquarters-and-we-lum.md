  administered a kick to the donkey’s hindquarters, and we lumbered forwards.
  Unbeknownst to me however, due to the sultry atmosphere in the theater, Lulu
  had discarded her clothes before donning the costume; I was also unaware that
  the two of them had recently begun a torrid love affair. Now, given the
  position of Orlofsky’s head within the creature . . . well, the reader can
  guess the effect on his stewed box. The animal reared forwards sending me
  toppling to the floor; moments later the writhing donkey had gone over the
  edge into the orchestra pit. The idiots, still trapped in the suit, lay there
  braying in the stunned silence that followed; unfortunately they had now
  forgotten themselves entirely, and Lulu, responding to Orlofsky’s overtures,
  bid him chase her. The donkey arose and began to stampede around the theater;
  one of the ushers managed to coral the animal, and in a misguided attempt to
  subdue it, delivered a solid blow to its muzzle. Never one to take an insult
  lying down, Lulu head-butted the poor man to the ground and proceeded to
  trample him with her hooves. He ran off but soon returned with several
  stagehands who managed to chase the inebriated donkey from the theater. The
  conductor, an altogether sound gentleman, addressed the audience: he hoped
  they had enjoyed the diversion, but the performance now would continue (minus
  the 3rd cello, smashed during the fracas). Burning with humiliation, I stood
  through the rest of the second act until my exit, somehow avoided the enraged
  director, and stumbled out to search for my foolish compatriots. 


  Some while later I found them at the police station; the animal was at the
  desk (Orlofsky and Lulu had been unable to escape the outfit, and no one had
  seen fit to release them) being jokingly chastised by the duty officer. The
  director was also there, alternating screaming abuse at the donkey and
  imploring the constable to put the creature behind bars. Soon, the head of
  theatre arrived – I feared we might be subject to a large fine, but he
  immediately smoothed things over and placated the raving director. Taking me
  aside he told me the reaction to the show had been astounding, he had been
  barraged with requests for tickets; of course it wouldn’t do to repeat such an
  affront to so serious work as Der Grüne Wanderer, but clearly we had a gift
  for farce, and he was planning to produce a revival of Die Fledermaus. Perhaps
  we might help with the staging?
